#Project Title
SMART-QA

#Overview
This project is a question and answer website where users can create an account, post their questions or doubts, and receive answers from other people. Users can also contribute by answering questions posted by others.

The website utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide additional features such as access to most asked keywords and categorization of questions into different categories. The NLP algorithms are employed to analyze the content of the questions and apply a support vector classifier to automatically categorize them into categories such as world, sports, business, and science.
